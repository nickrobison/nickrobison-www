The other week I <a title="PeerCDN GigaOm Article" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/peercdn-p2p-cdn/" target="_blank">came across</a> a pretty cool piece of technology called _<a title="PeerCDN" href="https://peercdn.com" target="_blank">PeerCDN</a>. _Originally described in a 2008 paper [cite]10.1109/CIT.2008.4594743[/cite] the basic idea is similar to that of technologies such as BitTorrent where important data is copied and distributed through a group of peers, in this case site users. What makes this approach unique is that instead of relying on plugins or client programs its uses a new protocol known as _<a title="WebRTC" href="http://www.webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> _which is pure Javascript and doesn&#8217;t require any user intervention and simply &#8216;works&#8217;, provided the user is running the latest version of Chrome or a Firefox Nightly.



Why this is so cool is that traditional CDN networks can be really expensive, around these parts we use _<a title="Cloudflare is cool" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> _which is free for small sites but not for real people. Another issue is the locality of CDN servers, while a site may be really popular in Juneau, Alaska if the nearest Akami data center is in Seattle users will still face a pretty significant delay. So what if you could use your site users to mirror and share your content for you? Oh wait, now you can.







So, while this is a really cool and clever system, it unfortunately raises a few important questions.



First, as far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no way for a user to control whether or not they wish to participate in a peer network, it&#8217;s simply enabled for any site that implements _PeerCDN_. Can you assume that if a user chooses to visit a website that they also consent to sharing files with other users? This issue becomes especially important for users staring down draconian bandwidths caps

Not only that, there&#8217;s currently no requirement for sites to announce that they&#8217;re using
