If you haven't checked out the _[Informatonauts][1] _podcast yet, you definitely should. We've added 3 new episodes since I last posted about this, and they've turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.

If you're not into technology, that's OK, we talk about other things. Ok, not really, it's mostly technology. And science. But you never know, maybe something will pique your interest.



You can subscribe on [iTunes][2], then you'll get each new episode automatically delivered to your i_{device}_ of choice. It's like a digital drone for your auditory enjoyment!
