Dear all,



I have not forgotten you, it's simply the fact that it's the end of the quarter and I'm pretty well swamped under with papers and such. Fear not, next week is my spring break and I have a few things I've been thinking about and I may spend some time elucidating them here. I've also been working on a few projects, some of which are pretty cool, so look forward to that.



In the mean time, here are a few things to keep you satiated.



1. This awesome video:







2. This cool paper [cite source='pubmed']23354052[/cite]



3. <a title="The Economist" href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21572231-new-way-financing-public-services-gains-momentum-commerce-and-conscience" target="_blank">This innovative idea</a>



4. The new share buttons at the bottom of the posts, you can even send directly to your Kindle for later reading. What will they think of next?



5. This great song







6. This picture of a cat
