The worst part about cooking, is the actual process of learning to cook. Specifically, the resultants of learning to cook, which consist primarily of largely unappetizing creations, this then destroys any desire to cook again, less you end up with something even worse then before. This vicious spiral is extremely difficult to overcome, and best rectified by aligning yourself with another person who doesn&#8217;t suffer from said spiral.



At least, that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been approaching it.
