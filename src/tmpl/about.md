My name is Nick Robison, I'm an engineer with the [United States Digital Services](https://usds.gov). 
I'm primarily assigned to the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://cms.gov) where I work on a number of projects related to data interoperability.

Previously, I was a graduate student at the University of Washington, in Biomedical and Health Informatics program.
My research was primarily focused on developing new data management techniques for complex, historical spatial data, primarily within the context of global health and disease survaillance.

I also spend a lot of time toying with a variety of technologies from geospatial analysis, to high performance computing.

This blog is a collection of snippets from my life, for those who are far away; musing on things I find interesting, and a dumping ground for what I wish to preserve for posterity. It&#8217;ll be laced with a fair amount of humor and tongue-in-cheek pop (at least at some point in time) culture references; however, don&#8217;t let that detract from how insightful and profound  I think these posts are.
