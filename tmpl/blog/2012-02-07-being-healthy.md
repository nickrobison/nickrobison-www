For those of you who enjoy the healthier side of foods (I do not count myself among you) my good friend Anna Busenburg is quickly becoming a Lafayette area expert and overnight sensation. If you don&#8217;t believe me, watch this [video][1] and you&#8217;ll agree. I can testify that anything she tells you to cook is amazing. If she didn&#8217;t cook healthy foods, I&#8217;d probably weigh like 200 pounds.
