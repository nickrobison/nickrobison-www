    Happy Birthday <em>nickrobison.com </em>(yesterday)! Yes, despite my best efforts, we&#8217;re still around, albeit, barely. It&#8217;s been a quiet year around here, with only a little traffic, and even fewer posts, but I guess that&#8217;s ok. For comparison, can see last year&#8217;s summary post <a title="Happy Birthday!" href="http://www.nickrobison.com/2013/01/26/happy-birthday/">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Without further ado, I present you 2013, in stats.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      13 posts (about half of last year).
    </li>
    <li>
      11 comments.
    </li>
    <li>
      1,203 visits (a little less then last year at 3.29 visits/day, which isn&#8217;t bad considered I had half the new content).
    </li>
    <li>
      836 unique visitors (much more then the year before, so the audience is growing).
    </li>
    <li>
      3,354 page loads.
    </li>
    <li>
      2.79 pages per visit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Average visit time was 2:38.
    </li>
    <li>
      Visitors from 44 different countries (with the US and Canada being the highest).
    </li>
    <li>
      10 different browsers on 10 different operating systems (I think the 1 Blackberry finally gave up, by Symbian seems to still be a thing).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The pretty pictures:

    As usual, most traffic comes almost entirely from the US, with a bit from Canada and Europe.

    In a surprising shift, the bulk of visitors are now from Washington (specifically Seattle), with Indiana supplying the third most traffic. Apparently I&#8217;m more interesting to Chicago then I am to my own family. (Yes, that was me showing my new PNW passive-aggressive side).

    So that&#8217;s the state of the website, we&#8217;re but a small blip in the world of the internet, but it&#8217;s still my little blip, and I love it very much. If you&#8217;ve been trolling around here you&#8217;ve probably noticed that some images aren&#8217;t loading correctly, and that the site can take FOREVER to come up. Yeah, I need to fix that. I&#8217;m trying to get to it this week, I just haven&#8217;t had the time.

    So thanks for sticking with me for another year, hopefully things will only continue to get better.
