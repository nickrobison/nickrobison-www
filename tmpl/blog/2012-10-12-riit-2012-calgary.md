Today I delivered my first technical presentation at the 1st Annual _Research in Information Technology_ (RIIT) Conference in Calgary, Alberta. It&#8217;s a brand new conference that is co-located with the Association of Computing Machinery&#8217;s _Special Interest Group in Technology Education_ (SIGITE) Conference. Yes, it really is as exciting as it sounds. I presented a paper I wrote during my undergraduate with [Dr. Tom Hacker][1] at Purdue, yes he&#8217;s a computer professor, and yes, his last name is Hacker, it&#8217;s funny.

The paper was titled &#8216;A Comparison of VM Deployment Methods for HPC Education&#8217;, the presentation went fairly well for my first time, there are quite a few areas for improvement, but overall it was a success.

I&#8217;ll be posting copies of presentations as I deliver them, along with links to <a title="Robison-Hacker Paper" href="http://sigite2012.sigite.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/session09-paper03.pdf" target="_blank">the paper</a> and [the slide deck][2].

Enjoy!
