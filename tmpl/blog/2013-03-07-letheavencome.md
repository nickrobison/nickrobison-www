Last night at my <a title="Small Groups" href="http://www.bluesky-church.com/smallgroups" target="_blank">Discipleship Community</a> (or DC if you&#8217;re in the know) we sang a song during worship with the bridge:



> Let heaven come
> 
> 

Throughout the night I kept coming back to that line, _let heaven come_. What a terrifying, terrifying thought. Do we really want heaven to come down? Are we actually ready for that?



We like to think about God coming back. Riding down amongst the clouds, proving wrong all those annoying atheists once and for all. I told you! I told you he was real! Then we get to the sinners, oh boy, now they&#8217;re in for it. God&#8217;s gonna come in and show them a thing or two, John Cash was right all along! Maybe while he&#8217;s here we&#8217;ll get one of those super &#8216;Jesus highs&#8217; you get from going to Christian conferences, only this one will last longer then 3 days. Boy, that&#8217;ll be awesome.



But that phrase means so much more then what we think it does.



> Your kingdom come,

> your will be done,

> on earth as it is in heaven.
> 
> &#8211; Matthew 6:10 (ESV)
> 
>

_Your will be done._ Right there, everything changes direction. His will? Really? Is that how that works? I thought heaven coming down only meant something for those people outside the Christian club! Nope. Heaven is God&#8217;s territory, what he says goes, no negotiations, no pleadings. If we really want heaven on earth, then we have to realize that the end result will be us being in total submission to the will and desire of God, that&#8217;s what heaven&#8217;s like, are we alright with that?



For most of us, we really like to have our own way. We like religion, just not too much. We like obeying God, but only until we start to look like &#8216;those people&#8217;. We desire holiness, but our sin is pretty fun too, and as long as God hangs out up there in heaven we can get away with just enough sin and disobedience to have a little extra fun while we&#8217;re here in earth. I mean, come on, he couldn&#8217;t have meant all my sin, some if it&#8217;s not really that big of a deal, everyone does it, and some people do way worse. So I&#8217;m sure God would be fine, it&#8217;s like par for the course. Again, nope.



Really, it&#8217;s not even about sin, it&#8217;s about all those things you know God asked you to do, but you didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s about all those times you feel those pangs in your heart to give something extra in the offering plate, sign up for the 3am prayer slot at Church, or invite that weird guy from accounting to lunch (they&#8217;re always from accounting). All those things you know you should be doing but find some sort of excuse not to. Now, imagine God is really here, heaven has actually come to earth, somehow those excuses don&#8217;t seem to cut it anymore.



_Let heaven_ come, but maybe not just yet. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span>



The second thing about heaven coming around is that God will be here, for real. Really here, and historically, that&#8217;s been a big deal.

The presence of the Lord is unlike anything we can imagine, it is great and glorious, beautiful and mighty. When heaven does come to earth, the physical presence of the Lord will come with it, and it will be incredible. Don&#8217;t think for a second that you can enter the presence of the Lord and not be changed. Don&#8217;t pretend that all your righteousness, pretenses, and excuses won&#8217;t be stripped bare in front of Yahweh of Armies. The presence of the Lord is both glorious and terrifying. Glorious, that&#8217;s why people immediatly fall to worship. Terrifying, that&#8217;s why the arrival of angels, mere wisps compared to the living God, announce their arrival with <em>fear not</em>, because the fear is real. We don&#8217;t know how to handle such awesomeness, we&#8217;re only human.

We should absolutely desire the coming of heaven, and desire for it to come soon, but my question is; are we really ready for it? Are we ready to surrender ourselves to the perfect will of God? Are we truly ready to stand in the presence of the King of Kings? Is that really what we want? If not, we have no business praying for it. This is not a joke, our worship means something, our prayers matter. If we don&#8217;t mean it, we shouldn&#8217;t sing it.

&#8211; Psalm 130:5-6 (ESV)

In my own life there are days when that is my prayer, days when I wait with anxious longing for the Lord to come in glory, to put things right, to restore the broken, to bind up the wounded. He has promised, let him not delay! I know that I have fallen short of the glory of God but still I know that his lovingkindness will be sufficient and I long to made right and to submit to his perfect will.

Then there are the rest of my days (most of my days if I&#8217;m being honest) when I&#8217;m pretty content with the way things are. I know that I&#8217;m in friction with God&#8217;s will, I know that I cling to my sin, but I&#8217;m ok with that. To me, it&#8217;s not really a big deal. I may stand in worship and sing <em>let heaven come</em>, but I don&#8217;t mean it, in fact, I may even be praying against it. I&#8217;m not ready to move on, I&#8217;m not ready to grow, I&#8217;m not ready to lay down my will. Those are the days when my worship is a lie.



We bandy religious word and platitudes like they&#8217;re simply phrases with no inherent meaning or worth, but they&#8217;re not. There&#8217;s a deeper meaning both beautiful and terrible. When we enter into worship we need to ask ourselves, do I mean it? Is what I confess with my mouth really what I believe in my heart? If not, then we need to do some serious work to get ourselves right before we come before the presence of the Lord. But the good news is, the Lord is faithful, he has great mercy and compassion, he longs to be gracious to us and meets us in our weakness, he stoops down from on high to work in our hearts and minds, to be continually bringing us into perfection. In a way, it&#8217;s a little taste of something greater to come.
