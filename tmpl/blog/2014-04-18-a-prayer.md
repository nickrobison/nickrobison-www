> Lord God,

> Creator of earth and matter,

> You both dazzle and hide,

> You call both light and shadow to be,

> You dwell on mountaintops,

> And in the nooks and crevices of the mountainside

> You speak in both fire and whispers.
> 
> Your very material creation -

> With all of its dirt and blood

> All of its smells and tastes,

> Is a playground for thought.
> 
> And so we - graced, privileged, and called - play

> At what must seem to you, sometimes, just games

> Is God to be found in the world? we ask, almost serious.

> Is the world the folding and unfolding of God's immanence?

> we inquire.

> As we try our questions, surely you chuckle, Lord -

> But I think that you chuckle because you like to play along -

> That you are glorified in our play, even our serious academic play.
> 
> Only you, Lord, God of a richly folded creation,

> Could be found in a place like Deleuze or Badiou,

> Could surprise us in the pleats of French philosophers,

> Could whisper in the creases of continental ontology.
> 
> Lord Jesus, you 'snuck yourself in matter' for our sakes,

> That we might be pulled out of our flat absorption in immanence -

> To be the 'charged' material image bearers of divine excess.

> Help us, then, Lord, to be your disciples above all -

> To discern what these texts mean for our discipleship,

> For our being-in-the-world

> Our being-for-others,

> And our being-for-you.
> 
> Amen
