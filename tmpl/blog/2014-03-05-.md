    <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Yesterday I was meandering through the grocery store, minding my own business, when my nose started itching. I thus did what any rational human being would do and began to lightly scratch it. As I was in mid-scratch one of the store employees turned around and looked at me, and with a slightly disgusted look on her face said &#8216;you have some on your forehead as well&#8217;. This encounter, besides being quite uncomfortable, taught me 2 valuable lessons.</span>

      Do not scratch your nose in public, you never know when someone might turn around. Yes, I know I probably should&#8217;ve learned this a long time ago, but I have an aversion to itching that only rivals my aversion to strenuous physical activity. I&#8217;ll do almost anything to avoid either.

      People in Seattle have no idea what <i>Ash Wednesday </i>is.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    It probably goes without saying that Seattle isn&#8217;t a very <em>churched</em> city. People often describe us as a <em>post-Christian</em> community, but that&#8217;s not true. A post-Christian community is one where people say things like &#8216;I used to be a Christian, but I&#8217;m not anymore&#8217;. Or, &#8216;I went to Catholic school when I was younger, it was ok. Not a lot of girls though&#8217;. In Seattle, we&#8217;re post-post-Christian. In that people say things like &#8216;Christians? Oh yeah, I read about you guys&#8217;. Or, &#8216;Wow, I didn&#8217;t realize that was still a thing&#8217;. Mostly, my experiences have been of the later type, which makes observing more public expressions of faith at times an awkward experience. People genuinely think you have dirt on your forehead, then when you explain to them that it&#8217;s Ash Wednesday, you then have to explain that it&#8217;s a part of Lent. Lent, as in, after Mardi Gras (and the lights go on).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, if the conversation is still progressing (as it did in the checkout of the grocery store today (not the same grocery store. I&#8217;m low on food, and forgetful, it takes multiple outings. Don&#8217;t judge me)), you get to start explaining the ideas behind Lent, or what fasting is, or why anyone would actually do that. Which of course brings up a really interesting question. Why do I observe Lent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The simple answer is, it&#8217;s a part of the Church calendar, and I observe the calendar, thus I observe Lent. The other answer has to do with Taleb&#8217;s ideas of <em>Antifragility</em>, but that&#8217;s probably not the answer people are looking for. And most people don&#8217;t know who Taleb is. In reality, the  answer (my answer, the one I personally ascribe to) is that Easter is coming and I want to be ready. Let me explain, Easter is the day of victory, it&#8217;s the day in which the resurrection power of heaven was made manifest on Earth and ushered in a new era of God <em>with us. </em>It&#8217;s a day in which God broke the power of death and set us free. It&#8217;s also the day in which remember that God is coming, what has already been accomplished has not yet to come pass. And so, I want to spend the time leading up to this glorious day preparing my heart and mind to be in a place where not only can I start to fully understand what God has done, and will do. But also get to

    For some people, this may not sound like that big of a deal, but for me, 5 weeks isn&#8217;t even really enough. Some people have real problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The rest of my year is largely filled with me. As much as I like to claim otherwise, my daily routine is about my plans, my dreams, my immediate needs, and if those plans and needs just so happen to align with the will of God, then awesome. If not, well&#8230;. So for me, Lent is a time which builds to something far, far beyond myself. It&#8217;s about a larger story in which I am but a fraction of fraction.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    This leads quite well into the question I get asked all the time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>What are you giving up for Lent?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My answer: <strong>I don&#8217;t know.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How can you not know? Everyone else seems to know, whether it&#8217;s coffee, or alcohol, or going to the gym, everyone seems to have an idea of what they&#8217;ve giving up. Well for me, it&#8217;s different, I&#8217;m not so much giving something up, as I am adding something else. For the past few years, my tradition has been to add 1 hour a day (outside of my daily devotions) of prayer, study, meditation, and journaling. I pick a book dealing with a spiritual topic, read a section, pray about it, and write down what the Lord is speaking to me. So whatever I have to give up in order to get this hour, whether it&#8217;s sleep, TV, personal reading, etc, then that&#8217;s what it is for that day. You see for me, one of my primary issues is prioritizing God an faith below all the other things that I need/want to do; too often my spiritual journey takes a backseat to whatever else I happen to be doing at that time. So by giving up 1 hour a day, along with whatever else I would be doing to fill that hour, has a far greater impact on my spiritual life then simply going without coffee for 5 weeks (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, at all, you should do whatever the Lord leads you to do).

    In case you&#8217;re wondering, this is the book I&#8217;ll be going through this season:

    It&#8217;s really good.

    So dear friends, as we embark on this wonderful end to the liturgical year I would like you leave you with the collect for the day, because people who crafted such things long ago, are far better then I ever will be.
