    Before we get into the book review, it&#8217;s important to flesh out some of the history between myself and the author, Pastor Judah Smith. This historical explanation should help in providing some additional understandings as to my motivations and resulting conclusions, as well as make for interesting reading.  My &#8216;relationship&#8217; with the author goes back several years and can easily be broken into 5 distinct time frames, and though we&#8217;ve never met in person, we&#8217;ve had our share of intersecting actions.

    2003: My High School youth group heads north to Toronto, Canada to attend the <a title="Freshwind 2013" href="http://freshwindconference.com/freshwind-2013" target="_blank">Fresh Wind </a>conference for the 2nd time. I am not in attendance as my Aunt has the nerve to schedule her wedding that same weekend. Upon reuniting with my friends they regale me with stories of this hilarious and super cool youth pastor from the far northern territory of Seattle. Over a summer mission trip to northern Canada (I&#8217;m detecting a theme) our endless hours in the van are filled with the many voices of Pastor Judah and I begin to feel like I was there hearing him in conference with all my peers. Our youth pastor has some interactions with Pastor Judah, flies out to see the mythical man, and meets Third Day instead, my friends consider the <a title="Generation Interns" href="http://thecity.org/interns" target="_blank">Generation Interns</a> program, things are getting closer.

    2008: The summer after my Freshman year in college a family vacation brings me to Seattle, my brother and I catch a bus to the U-District (though we didn&#8217;t really know that was a thing) to hear Pastor Judah (I call him PJ, we&#8217;re just that close) speak during one of their Wednesday night services. It was awesome, everything that I&#8217;d been dreaming of for all those years. I wanted to hang around after and meet the man behind the voice, but he spoke for what seemed like forever and we had to catch a bus, which we ended up chasing for 3 blocks down The Ave. Welcome to Seattle.

    2012: Grad school beckons and upon moving to Seattle I make the trip across the river for a Saturday night service, all the time thinking, perhaps tonights&#8217; the night, perhaps tonight&#8217;s the night. Judah didn&#8217;t preach.

    Now that I&#8217;ve firmly established the lightly stalkerish backstory, we can move on to the purpose of this post, a review of literature. This is a long post, it&#8217;s a bit wandery in places and would probably feel more at home in the <em><a title="CRB" href="http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/" target="_blank">Claremont Review of Books</a> </em>or <em><a title="TPD" href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/" target="_blank">The Public Discourse</a> </em>than on Amazon or Goodreads. It&#8217;s really more of my thoughts on the material, intersections I picked up on, and questions/suggestions I had after reading. Hopefully some bits and pieces of it will be helpful to some people, I&#8217;m not trying to rewrite the book or rephrase the author&#8217;s conclusions, merely using it as a stepping stone for additional contemplation and reflection.

    DISCLAIMER: As I mentioned earlier, I was given a pre-release copy of the book in exchange for helping spread the word on the Tweet-machine and its ilk, and for writing a review. They did mention writing an &#8216;honest&#8217; review (I think I have that in email form somewhere) and I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;re not nearly as litigious as <a title="Tesla Motors" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-motors-ceo-responds-to-ny-times-review-with-angry-tweets/" target="_blank"><em>Tesla Motors</em></a><em> </em>so I feel pretty safe giving a truthful review of the book; however, if you feel my journalistic integrity may be affected by said goodies, well that&#8217;s ok.

    The first thing you&#8217;ll notice upon receiving this book, is the brightly colored cover, slightly reminiscent of a cross between <em>The Brady Bunch</em> and <em>The Partridge Family</em> title slides, it&#8217;s really groovy. Next, you&#8217;ll wade through 4 pages of glowing reviews that hint at the fact that this may be the greatest book of our generation, if not the greatest, then possibly the penultimate in greatness. To me, it was a little off putting, I like Judah as much as the next guy, but the sheer number of superlatives is a little unsettling.

    <i>Jesus Is&#8230;. </i>Is there a more loaded phrase in the English language? For centuries people have been struggling to understand who this Jesus character is, and why he matters in our day-to-day lives. In this book, the author, Judah Smith, works at a high level of abstraction. He avoids dry theology, he moves beyond the issues of the historical Jesus, or the geo-political underpinnings of a new world order and presents a Jesus personal, real, and immediate. The person of Jesus, not the idea of him, a Jesus for you and me, a Jesus for the real and now; and it&#8217;s funny, this Jesus kind of looks like somebody I&#8217;d want to hang out with.

    Let&#8217;s be honest, everyone knows that this Jesus guy is supposed to be super holy and righteous, and of course, a fundamental facet of our nature is that we not hence, disconnected from this holy son of God.Even though a passing glance at the bible renders this logical train of thought into the structural consistency of Swiss Cheese, it&#8217;s utterly pervasive through our culture. Why would a holy God suffer my sin and want to hang around with me? Judah&#8217;s answer: Because he loves you, and to him, you&#8217;re worth pursuing and loving.

    In the first section we see Jesus doing all the things &#8216;good christians&#8217; would never be caught dead doing, he&#8217;s hanging out with professional sinners, being in community with them, ministering to them, and most of all, refraining from condemning them. And that&#8217;s the message especially for those in the Church, if God himself doesn&#8217;t condemn people, where do we get off doing so? Where is it our place to condemn and marginalize and put up barriers that keep people from experiencing the transformative grace and love of Jesus Christ?

    As Judah makes (partially) clear (we&#8217;ll get to that later), this is not to say that sin isn&#8217;t a big deal, that somehow we&#8217;re good enough on our own to win the affections of God. His point here is that sin is between us and God, and he alone can tall people to account for their choices and actions.

    We all screw up, we all have sinned and fallen short of the greatness we have been called into. For a humanistic world which operates off a utilitarian mindset of, you get what you earn and you are what you produce, failure can be a final state. Here&#8217;s the beauty of Jesus and the &#8216;salvation story&#8217;, it doesn&#8217;t work the same way.

      Life looks grey sometimes (especially for those of us who live in Seattle), it&#8217;s full of pain, full of sadness, and that tedious boredom that always creeps in and ruins an otherwise good week. So what are we to do? The simple answer is that since the world came out of chaos and randomness, with no coherent vision or motivation, there really isn&#8217;t any inherent purpose and meaning to life, thus we make it what we want and do as we please. Unfortunately, we all know how that&#8217;s turned out so far.

      Yet, that answer doesn&#8217;t sit well with us humans, we believe, deep down in the bedrock of our souls, that we are meant for something. That we were created for a purpose. That all this pain and suffering is not merely the out workings of some cosmic equation, that there&#8217;s meaning somewhere, somehow. And we struggle to find that meaning, and our purpose by whatever means necessary. And yet, there is really only one way to find that purpose and meaning. In a personal, loving God, unchanging:

      Judah hammers this point home with the story of Solomon, he had everything, and still it wasn&#8217;t enough, there was nothing on earth he didn&#8217;t have access to, and still he found himself in the depths of dispair. Then here comes Christ, claiming to give us hope and a future, purpose and destiny. Not in an abstract theoretical way, but in a real, personal way, a way that hit us where we live and work, a way that punches through the drudgery and monotony  and says, I have made you, I have loved you, and I will use you for great things.

There was something that He covered constantly by abrupt silence or impetuous isolation. There was some one thing that was too great for God to show us when He walked upon our earth; and I have sometimes fancied that it was His mirth.

        Something too great for us to understand, the mirth and joy of Christ. People do indeed have this idea that following Christ involves giving up all of the good things in life and perhaps even moving into a monastery somewhere and subsisting on solely bread and water. To those people I say, even monasteries brew beer.

        When The Lord created the earth he called it good (טוב) (tôwb) meaning, among many other things, delicious, desirable, agreeable. God made the earth, and he liked it, he liked it very much. The world is good, and we&#8217;re not exempt from enjoying it. Christianity is not a droll, boring faith for those who are pathologically averse to pleasure; it is not a dead orthodoxy inspiring a sort of abstraction from reality. It is a real, vibrant, enjoyable life chasing after the one who makes it all worthwhile. We are in the world, and we experience the world in real ways.

              With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. He not only gives them beings and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and brings them to their final end. Recognizing thus utter dependence with respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy, and confidence.

                For centuries man has been searching for the solution to all man&#8217;s ills. And they&#8217;ve developed a good many theories and promises, and yet, here we are still in the midst of suffering, still facing pain, still tainted with sin.

                The end to man&#8217;s ills is not found in man, but in something else. We cannot unmake ourselves, we cannot reconstitute into something better, something cleaner, something less rotten, it&#8217;s not possible. That&#8217;s where God comes in, he comes to bring us new life, a new birth, something that is fundamentally different from what we have, and in that, we find true freedom and redemption.

From one system you have empire and conquest, from the other you have commerce and industry. Everyday we strive to &#8216;get ahead&#8217;, to be better then others, to &#8216;get what&#8217;s mine.&#8217; We&#8217;re all Spanish at heart.

                  Not only has he come to redeem our future, but to cleanse us of our past. As the afore mentioned Neibuhr noticed, we respond to people primarily based on how we&#8217;ve interacted with them in the past, which is to say, our sin always goes with us. It&#8217;s forever tainting the way to look at people, and the way they respond to us. That&#8217;s why Christ&#8217;s sacrifice is so important, he took all our sin upon us, all our past mistakes and failures and did away with them.

                  A new creation, one without the stains of old, one without the primal strivings for success and power, something washed in the blood of the perfect sacrifice. We are not chained to what we&#8217;ve done, we&#8217;re empowered to fully embrace our future.

                    Overall, I thought this was an excellent book, Judah has a fresh, light writing style that moves quickly through topics and refrains from getting bogged down, or overly wordy (something the author of this post cannot claim). That being said, there were a few things I was a little less thrilled with.

                    The question I kept coming back to was, who is this book for? The author would probably claim: for everyone. While that response works great if you&#8217;re <a title="This Is For Everyone" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-twBP2VCV0" target="_blank">inventing the internet</a>, it works less well when writing a book. In my humple opinion there are 3 basic intended audiences; people outside the Church and curious about this Jesus guy, people familiar with God, but probably burned by the Church at some point, and long time believers who probably have a less then stellar track record when it comes to withholding judgement (I count myself in the latter). Based on those three groups I think the author did a pretty good job with his content optimization for the first two groups. The material is fresh (though not particularly novel or groundbreaking), the language is up to date, and the topics hit home right where people live and feel. If you&#8217;re wondering if the Church is more then laws and rules, this book is for you. If you&#8217;re feeling dry and empty trying to achieve happiness on your own, this book is for you. That being said, for long time Christians it&#8217;s a more difficult sell. While it&#8217;s true we should be continually revisiting the simple truths of the bible, the fact is, the book stops short. While it preaches compassion and mercy, it gives few answers on how to do so. At what points does looking past sin become, not considering it sin at all? Where do we draw the line between being in the world, and being of the world? Is there even a line at all? Perhaps these are simple questions that other readers won&#8217;t be bothered by, but they matter to me. I struggle to find the balance between justice and mercy, to live my life in a way that calls people to a higher standard of morality and holiness and that meets them where they are and loves them; because in all honesty, I&#8217;m not any better. I was looking for some answers, I was hoping for some Godly guidance, and largely came up empty handed, which was disappointing, but not wholly unexpected, it&#8217;s probably just beyond the scope of the book.

                      Let me be clear, I don&#8217;t have a problem with this because it&#8217;s not true, because it absolutely is, but I have an aversion to this type of thinking, that Jesus is our image of God (especially with the implication that&#8217;s the only way we see God)  because I think a lot of people have a really bad image of Jesus. To many Jesus is really more akin to the foil of Jesus that John P. Meier describes:

                      He&#8217;s more a good teacher and less a divine being. Which is completely false, Jesus the very nature of God, he is &#8216;God with skin on&#8217;, and we need to clear that this is a two way street, it&#8217;s not the love of Jesus and the divinity of God as two separate but intersecting spheres, it&#8217;s both, together, triune and single. This is a subtlety that escapes many people and has lead to some pretty wacky theology, and we here in the United States have done a pretty spectacular job of creating our own Christ. Stephen Prothero, in discussing this &#8216;American revolution&#8217; writes:

                        The third stage in this revolution fulfilled the promis of Jefferson&#8217;s vision for Jesus, liberating him from Christianity itself&#8230; It came to fruition in the midst of the post-1965 immigration boom, as Hindus and Buddhists boldly adopted Jesus as one of their own, unbinding him (at least for their purposes) from the Christian tradition&#8230; Americans of all religious persuassians (and none) felt free to embrace whichever Jesus fulfilled their wishes.

                      Perhaps this is simply myself reading with a sensitivity born out of the culture I&#8217;m living in, and I in no way want to accuse Pastor Judah of having a faulty theological basis, but at times it seems as if this book&#8217;s Jesus would just simply take an &#8216;anything goes&#8217; stance with regards to our sin; while the author attempts to claim this isn&#8217;t an indictment of morality or law, I don&#8217;t think he makes the case very well and I fear the undertones may be lost on our post-modern culture.

                      Those notes aside, I enjoyed my time reading the book, there were parts where I was in awe (again) over the mercy and grace of God, struck anew by the compassion of Christ, and convicted over the ways I&#8217;ve treated people in the past with regards to their choices and lifestyles. It was, overall an encouraging book that I would definitely recommend for people to read. If you&#8217;re looking to better understand Jesus, or to come to grasp with grace and mercy, or simply wanting to be reminded of the infinite mercies of our creator, this book is for you.

                        <span style="line-height: 15px;">Pg. 5. &#8211; Zacchaues definitely had some swagger, though I&#8217;m not sure it if was hip-hop swagger, or <em>Godfather </em>swagger. Personally, I picture him in a tracksuit, rocking the gold bling with an un-godly amount of chest hair spilling from his open shirt; thought that&#8217;s probably more of a stylistic choice.</span>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Pg. 44 &#8211; Great imagery, reminds me of Rembrandt&#8217;s <em><a title="The Return of the Prodigal Son" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_(Rembrandt)" target="_blank">The Return of the Prodigal Son</a>.</em>

                      <li>
                        Pg. 88 &#8211; I am convinced that <em>Saint John of the Cross&#8217; </em><a title="The Dark Night of the Soul" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Night_of_the_Soul" target="_blank">Dark Night of the Soul</a>, is actually 5:30 in the morning.

                      <li>
                        Pg. 118 &#8211; I would like to add some additional proverbs: <ul>
                          <li>
                            The Right Reverend Leo Tolstoy: <em>Happy Families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.</em> (I thought we needed some culture up in here).
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Brother Nicholas Robison: <em>Sometimes families cause you to miss out on incredible sermons presented at youth conferences in Canada.</em>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Based on the <em>Collected Watchings of the Throne</em> by Saints Kayne of West, and Jay a&#8217; Z, we know that families at times, make you get an education, and let you cook crack in the kitchen. Literally, life and death.
