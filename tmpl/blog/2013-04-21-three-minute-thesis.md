This quarter I'm taking a Teaching Methods class, which requires me to give a series of different presentations as well as teach an undergraduate level class (just one though, no need to torture the kids more then is absolutely necessary). This past week we had to present our dissertation research (or proposed research) to the rest of our classmates in under three minutes, or in my case, under 3:32. That's not really an easy task, especially when at this point my research is pretty much allÂ encompassing. As in, encompassing all of science, but I gave it my best shot.



In case you were wondering what it is I do all day, this should answer some questions.







Note: That breathing sound is not me sucking in a huge amount of oxygen, it's the compressor on the audio channel. Just thought I should clear that up.
