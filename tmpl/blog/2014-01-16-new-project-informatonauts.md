    There comes a time in very man&#8217;s life, when he looks at his buddy and utters one simple phrase &#8216;we should do a Podcast&#8217;. That time, my friends, has come.

    The story of this project is simple. My friend <a title="The World of Nikhil" href="http://www.nikhilgopal.com/">Nikhil</a> and I, like most friends, often find ourselves in various coffee shops and restaurants talking about all manner of interesting (at least, interesting to us) topics and ideas. With some regularity people around us will chime in with a thought or comment, or snicker at something one of us says. So we reached the most natural of conclusions. Let&#8217;s fuel our narcissism by recording our conversations and posting them online for all to revel in and enjoy. And thus, <em><a title="The Informatonauts" href="http://informatonauts.wordpress.com">Informatonauts</a> </em>was born.

    You&#8217;re probably thinking, that&#8217;s not even a word! To which, you would be correct. It&#8217;s less a word and more an assertion. It&#8217;s the conjunction of two ideas, information, and exploration. Traditionally, people in information science have been known colloquially as informaticists, which conjures up images of test tubes and network cables. But in reality, it&#8217;s so much more then that. It&#8217;s about exploration, about mapping the uncharted regions of knowledge. To go where no nerd has gone before.

    Or, it&#8217;s just an excuse to design a cool logo with astronauts on it. Cool logo is forthcoming.

    So, take a listen, let us know what you think. In this first episode, we discuss evidence of time travel on the internet, NASA approved plants, the best books of 2013, and how to keep your data from crapping out on you. All in all, a great way to spend 1:03:14. We&#8217;re still getting the hang of things, there are bugs to sort out, and awkward pauses that need to be obliterated. There&#8217;s also one host&#8217;s annoying habit of dominating the conversation, which needs to be rectified.

    We submitted the first episode to iTunes, it should be approved shortly, and the 2nd episode should be live by early next week, at the latest. Until then, you can hear the first episode (appropriately called <em>Unbounded Narcissism</em>) on our <a title="The Webpage" href="http://informatonauts.wordpress.com">website</a>, and follow us at <a title="The Informatonauts on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/informatonauts">@informatonauts</a>.

    Until next time, never stop exploring.
