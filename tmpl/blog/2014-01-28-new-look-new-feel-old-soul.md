    Look ma, new CSS!

    Yup, the old, venerable look was finally starting to show its age. So I did what any self respecting geek would do. I replaced with the newer, yet still stock, theme supplied by WordPress. Hello 2014, you&#8217;re looking real nice.

    Hopefully, you&#8217;ll also notice that the site is much more responsive and that some of the images that weren&#8217;t showing up previously are working again. There are still a few minor bugs to work out, but overall things should be much smoother.
