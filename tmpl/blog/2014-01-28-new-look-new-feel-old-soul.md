Look ma, new CSS!

Yup, the old, venerable look was finally starting to show its age. So I did what any self respecting geek would do. I replaced with the newer, yet still stock, theme supplied by WordPress. Hello 2014, you're looking real nice.

Hopefully, you'll also notice that the site is much more responsive and that some of the images that weren't showing up previously are working again. There are still a few minor bugs to work out, but overall things should be much smoother.

Let me know if you have any thoughts/comments/suggestions/rants/haikus for me. Again, thanks for reading.

Cheers,

Nick
