Today marks the 1 year anniversary of this humble website! Yes folks, one year later and we&#8217;re still hanging around for better or worse (probably worse). <a title="Danmark" href="http://www.nickrobison.com/2012/01/26/danmark/" target="_blank">We&#8217;ve come a long way from the horrifically winding, overly wordy, poorly grammarized inaugural post</a>, and hopefully this time next year will be an improvement over the current situation.

As I do, I thought it might be interesting to give a few statistics, complements of _<a title="The Googles" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. _Over the past few 12 months this site has seen:



* 28 posts
* 52 comments (2.85 comments per post)
* <span style="line-height: 15px;">1,896 visits (5.19 visits/day)</span>
* 714 unique visitors
* 4,560 page loads
* 2.41 page loads/visit
* The average visit duration was 2 minutes and 19 seconds
* Visitors from 36 countries
* 9 different browsers on 10 operating systems (It appears there&#8217;s only 1 blackberry left in the world)



Some cool images:<figure id="attachment_418" style="width: 1565px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As you can see, the overwhelming number of visitors are coming from the US.<figure id="attachment_421" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

And, within the US most of the visitors were from Indiana. What a surprise.



Over the next year I&#8217;m hoping to keep up with regular posting. One of the professors I worked with challenged me to write everyday, primarily academic writing, but I&#8217;m taking that to mean here as well. I&#8217;m planning on expanding on some technical projects I&#8217;m working on, which will appeal to a much more limited audience but could be kind of cool.



Thanks to everyone for reading, it means a lot to know that you&#8217;re out there and hopefully enjoying it. Here&#8217;s to another year!
