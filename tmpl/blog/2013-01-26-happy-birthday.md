    Today marks the 1 year anniversary of this humble website! Yes folks, one year later and we&#8217;re still hanging around for better or worse (probably worse). <a title="Danmark" href="http://www.nickrobison.com/2012/01/26/danmark/" target="_blank">We&#8217;ve come a long way from the horrifically winding, overly wordy, poorly grammarized inaugural post</a>, and hopefully this time next year will be an improvement over the current situation.

    As you can see, the overwhelming number of visitors are coming from the US.

    And, within the US most of the visitors were from Indiana. What a surprise.

    Over the next year I&#8217;m hoping to keep up with regular posting. One of the professors I worked with challenged me to write everyday, primarily academic writing, but I&#8217;m taking that to mean here as well. I&#8217;m planning on expanding on some technical projects I&#8217;m working on, which will appeal to a much more limited audience but could be kind of cool.
