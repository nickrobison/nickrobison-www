    Dear all,
  </p>

  <p>
    I have not forgotten you, it&#8217;s simply the fact that it&#8217;s the end of the quarter and I&#8217;m pretty well swamped under with papers and such. Fear not, next week is my spring break and I have a few things I&#8217;ve been thinking about and I may spend some time elucidating them here. I&#8217;ve also been working on a few projects, some of which are pretty cool, so look forward to that.
