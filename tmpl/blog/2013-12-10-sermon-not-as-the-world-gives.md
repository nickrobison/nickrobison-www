Last Sunday, I had the opportunity to deliver the weekly homily at <a title="Emmanuel Anglican" href="http://emmanuelseattle.com" target="_blank">Emmanuel Anglican Church</a> during our celebration of the Advent week of &#8216;peace&#8217;.



The sermon was based on a <a title="Jesus Christ, Hope" href="http://www.nickrobison.com/2012/12/24/jesus-christ-hope/" target="_blank">blog post</a> I wrote last year that looked at the distinctions between hope Christ presented himself, and is presented in scripture, versus some of the heroic myths of the ancient world and our larger understanding of government and human existence. For this past week I took that core and oriented it around the idea of peace in a world in conflict. Specifically, looking at how Christ may in fact be the one true hope for peace in our world, in that his arrival represents a fundamental restructuring of human relationships and a true understanding of governance and authority.



In listening to the audio the first thing that struck me was &#8216;man, do I talk fast&#8217;. As one of my friends so elegantly put it. &#8216;You need to reign in the tongue racehorses that pull your mental chariot&#8217;. So, apologies for the extremely rapid pace of the dialogue. I&#8217;m working on that.



You can get the audio <a title="Peace - Audio" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/churchplantmedia-cms/emmanuel_anglican_church/nick_robison_peace.mp3" target="_blank">here</a> and the slides are available [here][1] (which you may want to follow along with, as there&#8217;s a bit of artwork involved).



Take a listen, and let me know what you think.
