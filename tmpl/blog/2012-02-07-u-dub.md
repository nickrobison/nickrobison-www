This morning (or yesterday depending on where you are in the world) I received an email from The University of Washington informing me that I&#8217;d been accepted into the 2012 training cohort for the _Biomedical and Health Informatics PhD_ program. In addition, I was awarded 1 of 4 _National Library of Medicine_ per-doctoral training fellowships, which is a huge honor and provides tuition, health insurance, and a monthly stipend for the first 3 years.

I&#8217;ve wanted to go to UW ever since my family first went to Seattle after my sophomore year at Purdue. It&#8217;s a fantastic school and home to the number 1 medical school (for clinical medicine) in the US. As a state school it&#8217;s primarily focused towards students who live in the NW area (Montana, Oregon, Alaska, etc) but apparently I made the cut. It&#8217;s slightly humerous that UC San Diego (also an NLM grant school) didn&#8217;t even read my application, they just rejected me after the first round. I don&#8217;t know if that says more about them, me, or UW. Hopefully them.

So, unless something drastically changes or Michigan offers me a sweet deal, in August I&#8217;ll be moving to the Northwest. To all of you who&#8217;ve prayed for me and supported me over the years, thank you. This is a huge step forward and tremendous answer to prayer.

Go Huskies!
