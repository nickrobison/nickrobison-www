    It seems appropriate to start off this new blogging season in a new city with an obligatory photo of the Space Needle, which has the joint purpose of both giving a visual overview of the area in which I now live and inspiring begrudging jealousy from those who are not party to such a landscape. Thus:

    With that out of the way&#8230; no wait, one more:

    The Microsoft Atrium in the <em>Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering </em>where I am currently enjoying a coffee, scone, and some riveting discussions on using the new AMD APUs to drive 6 Kinect cameras in a joint surgery/underwater exploration project to do some sort of advanced motion tracking. These are my people.

    It&#8217;s been just over 2 weeks since I rolled up with the 3 best friends that anyone ever had, in Deer Bane, loaded down to the point of damaging the suspension. It&#8217;s been a great couple of weeks that alternated between sheer terror and utter boredom, along the way I&#8217;ve learned a few things that should make the future much more pleasant:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. The Walmart in Renton is the definition of rachet (thanks Daniel for that new phrase), imagine a dark, dingy maze designed to reward rats for their cleverness, but instead of cheese what awaits you is the equivalent of a mosh pit with 500 of your not closest friends.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. An effective way to earn money is to sit on the side of the street with a sign hung by a string on a pole that says &#8216;Fishing for Beer Money&#8217;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. Some cities, in lieu of roosters, wake up their neighbors via a young man walking down the street shouting &#8216;F*** you! F*** you, you stupid B****!&#8217; at the top of his lungs. It&#8217;s actually quite effective.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. The amount of food required by 1 person is significantly less then the amount required by 7, especially if 1/7th of the consumers are Nathaniel Robison. Thus, opening the fridge should not automatically result in the thought &#8216;Oh no, I have no food&#8217;, though it often does.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. Comcast is evil. (But you already knew that)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    6. The hospital shuttle busses will take you downtown for free, it saves $4.75/trip and only adds 4 miles of walking.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    7. Life is a lot quieter then I&#8217;d previous believed, which is probably the result of living with the Robisons for all those years and my time at Fairway.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8. Old apartments have bugs, though I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the optimum spider-to-termite ratio.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. In a small apartment not setting off the smoke detector is nigh impossible, even with the overhead fan on, especially if the chef is myself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10. Refusing to stock non-local, non-organic food in the groceries and charging $0.05 per paper bag may be a sign of a socialist revolution, but it enables me to have immense moral superiority over the ignorant masses. &#8216;Wait, you still use paper bags? Philistine.&#8217;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    11. Seattle Churches are currently suffering from a dearth of qualified drummers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    12. Sometimes streets are actually stairs, and that&#8217;s ok.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    13. You can freeze milk.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    14. Libraries are awesome, especially when you have many hours in the day with which to read. Though, Purdue&#8217;s libraries seem to be far superior.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    15. Going from a place where you are known and where you have purpose to a place where you are unknown and trying to establish who you and what you&#8217;re called to do is hard. Maybe when the dust settles a little I can expand more on this.
  </p>

    So that&#8217;s where I am, I&#8217;m starting to establish a routine, find places I like to hang out, and the hidden treasures around me. It&#8217;s been a fun process to determine things that I really like to do and things that I&#8217;m no a huge fan of (you&#8217;d think after 23 years I&#8217;d know myself pretty well, but you&#8217;d be mistaken). I&#8217;m working on using this time to become more open to Christ and to listen to the things he&#8217;s trying to teach me. I&#8217;ll try and post a few photos of my new habitat, once it becomes picture ready, which may take some time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m off to my office (yes I have an office, in a trailer) to start getting up to speed on some new stuff.
  </p>

    Until next time
