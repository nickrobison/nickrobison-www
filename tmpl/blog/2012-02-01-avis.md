    I&#8217;m famous!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On friday the local newspaper here in Holbæk ran an article on Søren and the show he booked for the <a title="Koncert" href="http://www.nickrobison.com/?p=43">weekend</a>, in the article, he mentioned a certain American exchange student who was staying with them for the semester and would be attending the concert as well. Needless to say, I&#8217;m pretty much a local celebrity now. Good thing I always commute in the dark else, it might be an ordeal.
