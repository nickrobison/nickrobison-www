I'm famous!

On friday the local newspaper here in Holbæk ran an article on Søren and the show he booked for the [weekend][1], in the article, he mentioned a certain American exchange student who was staying with them for the semester and would be attending the concert as well. Needless to say, I'm pretty much a local celebrity now. Good thing I always commute in the dark else, it might be an ordeal.
