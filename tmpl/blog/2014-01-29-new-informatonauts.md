    If you haven&#8217;t checked out the <em><a href="http://informatonauts.wordpress.com">Informatonauts</a> </em>podcast yet, you definitely should. We&#8217;ve added 3 new episodes since I last posted about this, and they&#8217;ve turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.

    If you&#8217;re not into technology, that&#8217;s OK, we talk about other things. Ok, not really, it&#8217;s mostly technology. And science. But you never know, maybe something will pique your interest.
