Last night my host parents took me to see _Tim Christensen and the Damn Crystals_ at one of the local clubs here in Holbæk. Apparently these Danish guys are a big deal, they've been around for a long time both as this band and previously as _Dizzy Miss Lizzy. _

The show itself was awesome, they were preceded by <a title="Freja Loeb" href="http://www.myspace.com/frejaloebofficial" target="_blank">Freja Loeb</a> and her band, they're really strange but their music is pretty good and the mix was solid. It's a little sad that both shows I've been to in Europe have sounded better then 90% of the shows I see in the States. Anyways, Tim and his band were amazing, it's really odd to hear him talk to the crowd in Danish and then sing in English.



I shot a short video on my phone:
