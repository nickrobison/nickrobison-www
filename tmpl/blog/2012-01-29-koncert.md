    Last night my host parents took me to see <em>Tim Christensen and the Damn Crystals</em> at one of the local clubs here in Holbæk. Apparently these Danish guys are a big deal, they&#8217;ve been around for a long time both as this band and previously as <em>Dizzy Miss Lizzy. </em>

    The show itself was awesome, they were preceded by <a title="Freja Loeb" href="http://www.myspace.com/frejaloebofficial" target="_blank">Freja Loeb</a> and her band, they&#8217;re really strange but their music is pretty good and the mix was solid. It&#8217;s a little sad that both shows I&#8217;ve been to in Europe have sounded better then 90% of the shows I see in the States. Anyways, Tim and his band were amazing, it&#8217;s really odd to hear him talk to the crowd in Danish and then sing in English.
